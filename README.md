# Enhancement-and-Detection-of-Mastcam-Images

This project aims to enhance mars pictures and applies unsupervised learning techniques to cluster Mars surface images. By extracting deep features with a VGG16 model, it explores clustering algorithms like KMeans++, Agglomerative, and Gaussian Mixture Models to group images based on visual similarity, aiding in the automated analysis of Martian landscapes for exploration and research purposes.
